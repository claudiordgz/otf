# Serverless CRUD API with data from randomuser.me

This example shows how to setup a RESTful Web Service that allows to Create, List, Get, Update, Delete Users. It has been built with the payload from randomuser.me in mind and another script copies data from the API into DynamoDB. 

## Setup

This repo assumes you have an AWS Profile and Serverless Framework installed and configured. Afterwards it is necessary to install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## Build

To build the bundle with no deployment use:

```
npm run build
```

It uses webpack to bundle the code and keeps `aws-sdk` outside of your bundles, keeping your lambdas under 200KB. It will only deploy 1 file to S3.

## Testing

Running tests will output a coverage report for you, if the tests fall below 90% Code Coverage they will fail.

```
npm run test
```

## Deploy

Builds and deploys the application using the serverless framework.

```
npm run deploy
```

The expected result should look like:

```
Î» npm run deploy

> user-api-serverless@0.0.1 deploy D:\workspace\orange-theory-fitness\user-api
> npm run build && sls deploy


> user-api-serverless@0.0.1 build D:\workspace\orange-theory-fitness\user-api
> webpack
